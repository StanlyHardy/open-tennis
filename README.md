# Score Watcher
### Detect and recognize the Player information from the scoreboard. The Scoreboard detection is done via [Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) has been used to run inference. The Player information is extracted via CRNN or TessarOCR.
